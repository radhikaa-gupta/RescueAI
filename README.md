## Overview

This project aims to provide a quick and accurate assessment of disaster-affected areas using satellite imagery and AI. The system analyzes 'Before' and 'After' disaster images to identify affected regions, assess damage severity, and prioritize rescue efforts.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload satellite images depicting the location before, during, and after the disaster.
- **Damage Assessment**: Analyze uploaded images to generate a comprehensive damage assessment report.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualize affected areas and their severity on an interactive map.
